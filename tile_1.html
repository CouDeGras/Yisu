    Hi there! I’m a robotics engineer and IoT specialist currently immersed in the world of autonomous systems as an MSc Robotics student at the University of Birmingham. My research dances along the edges of autonomous robotics, artificial intelligence, and distributed systems, with a spotlight on human-robot interaction and secure networked robotic systems. In short, I make robots smarter, safer, and (hopefully) better at getting along with humans.
</p>
<p>
    Lately, I’ve been exploring how robots can take directions the way we humans do—through voice. Picture this: robots navigating their way around using OpenAI Whisper for speech recognition, Llama 3.2 for natural language understanding, all choreographed within the ROS2 framework. This project is my attempt to make human-robot interaction as natural as asking someone for directions (minus the questionable shortcuts).
</p>
<p>
    In the realm of distributed robotics, I’ve worked on creating secure wireless mesh networks that bring swarm robotics closer to reality. Think encrypted robotic teamwork, powered by ECDH key exchange and AES-128 encryption. My work on this was presented at the 2nd International Conference on Intelligent Manufacturing and Robotics (ICiMR), where I showed how robots can cooperate securely—even when humans can’t.

    I’ve also dipped my toes (or wheels) into computer vision for robotics. One standout project? An autonomous irrigation robot equipped with YOLOv8 for plant recognition and ROS2 navigation for, well, navigating. This smart little system could identify thirsty plants and water them with pinpoint precision, earning me a spot at the IEEE SmartIoT 2024 conference.

    Outside the lab, I’ve been lucky to gain hands-on experience in industrial robotics and IoT applications. From developing AI-powered vision systems that spot road damage to designing hardware for robotic arms, I’ve learned how to blend theory with practice—and had a lot of fun along the way.
</p>
<p>
    Looking ahead, my goal is to keep pushing the boundaries of robotics. I’m especially excited about creating systems that are not only innovative but also intuitive, robust, and secure—robots that fit seamlessly into human environments and maybe even surprise us with how helpful they can be.
